# Final-project
In this final project we created a site for people to watch anime. This site has 3 pages, the first one is the Home.html which talks about anime and 
the different genres in them. The second one is Genres.html which provides you with 6 anime genres with a total of 60 anime inside. The final one uses an API 
that uses javascript to fetch the data and display them by image, title, and then a summary of the anime.
